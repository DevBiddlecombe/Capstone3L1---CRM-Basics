Company task manager

This program will assist a company in managing tasks assigned to each member of the team. It works off "user.txt" and "tasks.txt" as databases.
Tasks stores all tasks user are working on and users stores login details for each user (username and password.)
There is a menu option for users as well as a menu option for admins.

*users will be able to*
- add tasks
- view all tasks
- view my tasks - change a task to complete, edit the deadline, edit the user assigned to the task , edit the due date - only if the task is incomplete.
- exit

*admins will be able to*
-register new users
-generate report files on users and tasks such as tasks overdue and incomplete, how many tasks are active etc. (task_overview.txt & user_overview.txt)

When a task is created the date will be automatically filled in. 
The program can search for which tasks are overdue by comparing them to the deadline date.
